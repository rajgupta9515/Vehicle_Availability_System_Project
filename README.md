Vehicle Availability System 

🔍 Project Overview
The Vehicle Availability System is a comprehensive web-based application designed to monitor and manage vehicle listings and their availability in real-time. It serves two categories of users: Dealers, who have the authority to manage vehicle inventory, and General Users, who can explore listed vehicles. The system ensures security through role-based access, enabling each user type to interact with the application according to their assigned permissions.
